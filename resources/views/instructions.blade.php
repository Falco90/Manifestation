    <h3>"You can't just visualize and go eat a sandwich" - Jim Carrey</h3>
    <p>Here I will write some instruction on how to manifest. Will get updated soon!<br><br> 
        The Law of Attraction involves more than just spending a few minutes visualizing your goals, it's the entire creation process that manifests your desires. You have to believe it and take action towards your desire. <br><br> 
        You create your entire reality. Every event that takes place, every experience you have – they are all your creation. You are the creator of everything through your intentions and desires. Whether it's the most amazing experience of your life or a crappy day at work, you are the creator. In every moment, ask yourself, “What do I want to create?”
